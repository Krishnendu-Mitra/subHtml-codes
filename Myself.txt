Ahoy hoy, I’m Krishnendu. I'm a web developer with 
in-depth experience in Html/Css design. In sort, 
I create websites that help organizations address 
business challenges and meet their needs. I manage 
everything from website navigation and layout to a 
company's web hosting and security architecture. My 
expertise lies within front-end website, and the main 
languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, and 
of course HTML/CSS. I’m a lifelong learner (currently 
taking a course on b.tech with CSE!) and love to read 
comic, run, and find new game in Kolkata city.
